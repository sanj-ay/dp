                <h1>The view from halfway down</h1>
                <p> Few years before I considered people who hangs themselves as losers. not anymore. The more I face
                    reality more I understand them. If you think people who hang themselves have deeper thoughts it's
                    the other way. you have deep thoughts then at some point you realise nothing matters and it's all
                    bullshit suddenly boom. I guess it's a consequence of the time we're in where doing most stuff only
                    needs some passive skills like pressing buttons or looking at a screen. We get a lot of time with
                    our mind because of it. we can think through a lot without disturbance and we end up thinking more
                    than we should and that together with all the shit happening outside, one might feel like they
                    should end it.
                    Suicide doesn't make sense from the outside especially If they have everything the observer wishes
                    for. Money, good looking girlfriend or good status in society. remember that actor Sushant Singh
                    Rajput? from everyone else's perspective, he had everything.</p>
                <p>Probably everyone who thinks of hanging end like " Anyway I'm going to die, all these do even
                    matter?" At least I was there. every night I'd go to sleep hoping to not wake up the next morning.
                    and wake up every morning hoping it's the last one.</p>
                <p>It was there before. but the quarantine and not having anything to do and a lot of time did that. At
                    least I decided to see a doctor. not everyone does that or even realises that it's a problem that
                    should be treated in some way. you don't necessarily need a therapist to be honest. you just need
                    someone you can trust to openly talk to, without fear of judgement.
                    In the modern era, you have an interpretation of your fanâ€™s image of you. People who face reality
                    understand that there are no fans only you.</p>
