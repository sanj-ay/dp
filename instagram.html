          <h2 style="text-align: center;">Instagram</h1>
            <p>How often do you look at mirrors? Not many times as you look into your own Instagram feed. You refresh it
              unconsciously but consistently all over the day. It is the only vaccine we had during lockdowns (Vaccine
              had side effects :P)</p>

            <p>Sometimes you regret or feel miserable for infinitely scrolling through Instagram ( Exact feeling after
              masturbation or procrastination ). The real challenge is to manage Instagram usage without much effort.
              Maybe you can manage it by putting in the effort (It's discipline). Then the next thing you do is
              uninstall the app or deactivate/delete the account. </p>

            <p>It's like deleting your pornhub account. They know you'll impulse delete the account after having post
              nut clarity. When the clarity fades away, you'll want to create a new account(maybe). So they keep your
              account available for 30 days because they know for a fact that you'll return. The same goes for
              Instagram. the only difference is if it is post nut clarity for pornhub, it's some other realisation like
              "what am I doing with my life?" for Instagram. There is this line from Bojack which states ''It's funny
              that when you see people being them it ruins them.'' We live by our social preconceptions over the
              internet. But in reality, everyone has their fair share of ordeals and Social media masks them perfectly.
            </p>

            <p>Everyone can't get out of Instagram. It's just like molecules at the surface of the water. Some molecule
              leaves due to an accidental, extra accumulation of a little bit more than ordinary energy, which it needs
              if it is to break away from the attractions of its neighbours.</p>

            <p>Humans are suckers for flattery. That can be a reason behind introducing stories. Though this platform
              everyone has live access to see the good part of people who are conventionally rich, famous, or
              good-looking. we tend to assume that their lives are rewarding. It urges us to make connections with them
              through DMS by stating the obvious or being nice. It can lead to jealously as well. We don't become
              jealous once we get away with what we want. If you can't do that or don't know how to do that maybe you
              feel jealousy towards someone who did that. </p>
            <p>They say social media brings people together while very often than not what you get is the outskirts.
              Remember the last metropolitan city you visited. When you think about the beautiful places within the
              cities. It's often the city outskirts. That is what Instagram is. It's the equivalent of your city
              outskirts. At the end in this hyperconnected world, we choose to remain within our outskirts. Choosing not
              to address the pollution within. Overtime being unreachable become a high form of status signal.</p>
