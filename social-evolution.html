                        <p>Being a kid in a more socially knit town I have often been asked what I wanted to be when I
                            grow up. That to me was a trick question. As a small-town Malayalee, the social expectation
                            is usually to become a doctor, a government employee, or to go abroad. Today, when people
                            ask me "മോൻ ഇപ്പോ എന്ത് ചെയാ?" ( Translation: "What do you do? " (for a living)), I answer
                            it like most South Indians answer the question. I answer "ഞാൻ കൊച്ചിയിൽ ജോലി ചെയ്യാണ്"
                            (Translation: I work in Kochi. (City in Kerala)), which in no way shape or form answer the
                            question but seems to satisfy most people, which remains a testament to the fact that nobody
                            fucking cares.</p>

                        <p> Anyhoo, to answer the question earlier, what did I want to be a kid? I wanted to run away
                            from my family and perform animal slavery. Uhm... I meant I wanted to be a Pokémon™ trainer.
                            I dreamed of living in a carefree world where kids have learned the secrets to living
                            without money and have developed the ability to never age. A world where I could roam around
                            meet people and generally have fun just like the never-aging protagonist Satoshi (Ash
                            Ketchum for the dubbed enthusiasts).</p>

                        <p> This is a dream I could have dreamt. I recently saw the trailer to the Nawazuddin Siddiqui
                            movie Serious Men. Nawaz's character monologues about something he phrases as the 4G theory.
                            It conveys the idea (or at least what I deciphered from the 10-second dialogue) that the
                            dreams and aspirations of every generation build the foundation for the next. Most of you
                            reading this, probably have well-educated parents. For them, their life goal was to be
                            financially independent or to be financially secure. These are things most of us today take
                            for granted because it is much easier for us to achieve and for most of us, that dream is a
                            foundation upon which we stand. Most of our grandparents dreamed about being educated and so
                            on. </p>

                        <p>This concept is very similar to the theory of evolution proposed by Charles Darwin. Every
                            generation passes down the skills it acquired to their children. Thus resulting in a more
                            advanced civilization. This happens because the world we live in is modeled after the
                            ambitions of our former generations. The world we live in is shaped after capitalism the
                            byproduct of the ambitions of people that came before us.</p>

                        <p>Our generation seems to be focused on finding ourselves and deriving meaning to what we do.
                            For our former generation, this remains an alien concept. Just like toilet papers and sporks
                            are to the Asian culture. This is the reason more often than not, we nor our parents fail to
                            understand each other. The reason for generation gaps and miscommunication. And most
                            importantly the reason why vague answer about your careers seems to satisfy people. For
                            them, it is not about what you do, it is how well you are doing. Because it to them is a
                            testament to how good you are doing in the world they and their ancestors have made.
                        </p>
